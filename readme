To use the Text Censorship program, once the web app is open via localhost or live server: 
1.    Input the desired text into the text box
2.    Click the 'Censor text' button.
3.    Then, copy the censored text from the text box, and you are all ready.

All ALPHANUMERIC characters will be censored. Punctuation and spaces will not. There is an option in the javascript file for how you want the censoring to look. Your options:

1. The dog is "red" => The dog is "XXX"
2. The dog is "red" => The dog is XXX

I hope you enojy this product, and will leave a good review.
